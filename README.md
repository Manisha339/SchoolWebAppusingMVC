# SchoolWebAppusingMVC
1. Here i used three controllers namely StudentController, teacherController, and classController.

2. And also three models which define the data namely StudentModel, teacherModel, and classModel.

3. And also used a DataLayer which has two classes and an interface.

      3.1 It contains AppContext.cs file uses Dbset for all the three models.
      
      3.2 It contains BaseRepository.cs file which implements all the methods of IBaseRepository.
      
      3.3 It is an interface.
      
4. It also has a baseModel which is implemented by all the models.
